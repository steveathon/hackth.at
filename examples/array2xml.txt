Here be the readme for array2xml.php

Disclaimer: This class was written as an example to show a use of method
overloading. As with all examples that will end up here, this is for fun
only and experimentation. Try not to use this code in a production envi-
ronment, as I'm not sure what the results will be.

Simple example of how to use this class.

	1) Include it
	2) Build your array;
		$Example = array('moo' => array ('foo','boo','coo'), 'chocolate' => 'yummy' )
	3) Declare the class with your array;
		$OutputXML = new pushOutputXML($Example)
	4) Use the public variable as an object to output as xml
		print_r($OutputXML->_outputObject->asXML())
	
Enjoy.
